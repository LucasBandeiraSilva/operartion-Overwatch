Operation Overwatch is a microservices architecture developed with Spring Boot to manage the registration of superpowered beings. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents can register supers, who are then sent via messaging to the logistics microservice, which is responsible for generating and publishing a complete PDF report on each individual.
